# Usage Modes

MutaFuzz provides three distinct modes, each optimized for different fuzzing workflows:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Single Request" href="/modes/single-request" icon="crosshairs">
    Fuzz one HTTP request with `%s` placeholders
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiple Requests" href="/modes/multiple-requests" icon="list">
    Send requests from Proxy History/Logger/Target
  </Card>
  <Card title="Empty Panel" href="/modes/empty-panel" icon="code">
    Build requests programmatically
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Quick Comparison

**Single Request** - Select text in any Burp request, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd>, and fuzz it immediately. Best for quick parameter testing.

**Multiple Requests** - Select multiple requests from Proxy History and send them all to MutaFuzz. Best for batch testing and analyzing application flows.

**Empty Panel** - Start with a blank panel and build requests using Python and the Burp API. Best for advanced automation and custom fuzzing algorithms.

<Info>
Choose the mode that fits your workflow. You can use different modes for different tasks.
