## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is MutaFuzz?" icon="circle-info" iconType="solid">
    MutaFuzz is a Python-scriptable fuzzer for Burp Suite Professional. It provides a flexible fuzzing framework with intelligent learn mode filtering, multiple usage modes, and full access to Burp's Montoya API.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need Burp Suite Professional?" icon="shield" iconType="solid">
    Yes. MutaFuzz requires Burp Suite Professional (version 2025.3 or later) with Montoya API support. It will not work with Burp Suite Community Edition.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which Burp Suite version do I need?" icon="code-branch" iconType="solid">
    MutaFuzz requires Burp Suite Professional version 2025.3 or later. Earlier versions lack Montoya API support and cannot load the extension.

    Check your version: **Help → About Burp Suite**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is MutaFuzz free?" icon="dollar-sign" iconType="solid">
    Yes. MutaFuzz is open source and free to use. However, it requires Burp Suite Professional, which is a commercial product.

    **GitHub:** https://github.com/theblackturtle/mutafuzz
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does MutaFuzz compare to Burp Intruder?" icon="scale-balanced" iconType="solid">
    MutaFuzz complements Intruder with Python scripting and learn mode:

    **MutaFuzz advantages:**
    - Full Python scripting for complex logic
    - Learn mode auto-filters baseline responses
    - Multi-step workflows with session state
    - Programmatic request generation

    **Intruder advantages:**
    - Built-in attack types (sniper, battering ram, pitchfork)
    - Grep extract/match without coding
    - Resource pool integration
    - GUI-based payload configuration

    **Use MutaFuzz when:** You need Python scripting, multi-step workflows, or intelligent filtering.

    **Use Intruder when:** GUI-based fuzzing is sufficient.
  </Accordion>

## Installation & Setup

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Where do I download MutaFuzz?" icon="download" iconType="solid">
    Download the latest JAR from GitHub releases:

    **https://github.com/theblackturtle/mutafuzz/releases**

    Look for `mutafuzz-vX.Y.Z.jar` (or latest version).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I install the extension?" icon="puzzle-piece" iconType="solid">
    1. Download `mutafuzz-vX.Y.Z.jar` from GitHub releases
    2. Open Burp Suite Professional
    3. Go to **Extensions → Installed → Add**
    4. Select "Java" extension type
    5. Choose the downloaded JAR file
    6. Click "Next"
    7. Verify "MutaFuzz" tab appears in Burp

    See [Installation Guide](/installation) for detailed steps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Extension won't load - what should I check?" icon="triangle-exclamation" iconType="solid">
    **Check these common issues:**

    1. **Java version:** Check compatibility (`java -version`)
    2. **Burp version:** Must have Montoya API support
    3. **Extension type:** Must select "Java" not "Python"
    4. **JAR corruption:** Re-download from GitHub releases
    5. **Error logs:** Check Extensions → MutaFuzz → Errors tab

    See [Installation Guide](/installation) for detailed setup steps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where are my scripts stored?" icon="folder" iconType="solid">
    **Built-in scripts:** Embedded in JAR (cannot modify)

    **Custom scripts:** Configure in Dashboard → Config tab → Scripts Dir

    **To use custom scripts:**
    1. Create directory (e.g., `~/mutafuzz-scripts/`)
    2. Dashboard → Config tab → Scripts Dir → Browse
    3. Scripts appear in dropdown with built-in scripts

    See [Installation Guide](/installation) for setup details.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage & Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is learn mode?" icon="brain" iconType="solid">
    Learn mode automatically filters baseline responses to show only interesting results.

    **How it works:**
    1. **Calibration:** Send random payloads to establish baselines
    2. **Pattern detection:** Track status, length, body hash variations
    3. **Smart filtering:** Only show responses different from learned patterns
    4. **Group-based:** Multiple learn groups for different payload types

    **Use `@filter.interesting()` decorator to enable filtering.**

    See [Learn Mode Guide](/scripting/learn-mode) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the usage modes?" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left" iconType="solid">
    MutaFuzz has three ways to start fuzzing:

    **1. Text Selection Mode**
    - Select text → Right-click → "Open MutaFuzz (selecting text)"
    - Text becomes `%s` marker for payload injection
    - Best for parameter/path fuzzing

    **2. Multiple Requests Mode**
    - Select multiple requests → "Send requests to MutaFuzz"
    - Access via `templates.all()` in Python
    - Best for bulk request testing

    **3. Empty Panel Mode**
    - Dashboard → "New Empty Panel"
    - No pre-loaded template
    - Build requests entirely in Python
    - Best for programmatic fuzzing

    See [Usage Modes](/modes/index) for detailed comparison.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I fuzz multiple positions?" icon="arrows-left-right" iconType="solid">
    Use multiple `%s` placeholders in your request template. Placeholders are replaced sequentially from the payload list.

    Example: `GET /api/%s?id=%s HTTP/1.1` with payloads `["admin", "123"]` becomes `GET /api/admin?id=123 HTTP/1.1`

    See [Template Structure](/scripting/template-structure) for battering ram, pitchfork, and cluster bomb patterns.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I extract data from responses?" icon="scissors" iconType="solid">
    Yes! Use `handle_response()` to extract data with regex, store in `session`, then use in subsequent requests.

    Access response data via: `req.text`, `req.body`, `req.httpResponse`, `req.status`, `req.headers`, `req.cookies`

    See [Script Examples](/scripting/examples) for multi-step workflows with extraction patterns.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I send requests sequentially?" icon="list-ol" iconType="solid">
    Use `.send()` for synchronous execution (blocks until response), `.queue()` for async (returns immediately).

    **Key differences:**
    - `.send()` returns response object directly
    - `.send()` does NOT trigger `handle_response()` callback
    - `.send()` responses NOT auto-added to results table
    - Must call `table.add()` manually if needed

    See [Synchronous Requests](/scripting/examples#synchronous-request-chaining) for chaining patterns.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Python Scripting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which Python version does MutaFuzz use?" icon="python" iconType="solid">
    MutaFuzz uses **Jython 2.7** (Python 2 on JVM). Use Python 2 syntax - no f-strings, C extensions, or Python 3 libraries.

    See [API Reference](/scripting/api-reference) for complete scripting guide and available objects.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why isn't my script working?" icon="code" iconType="solid">
    Common issues:
    - Missing `handle_response()` or `queue_tasks()` functions
    - Forgot to call `fuzz.done()` at end of `queue_tasks()`
    - Syntax errors (check Errors tab)
    - Script not selected in dropdown
    - Engine not started (click Start)

    See [Template Structure](/scripting/template-structure) for required function signatures.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I debug scripts?" icon="bug" iconType="solid">
    Use `print_log()` and `print_err()` for logging. View output in:
    - Dashboard → Output tab (per instance)
    - Burp → Extensions → MutaFuzz → Output/Errors tabs (global)

    See [Script Examples](/scripting/examples) for debugging patterns.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
