## Prerequisites

Before installing MutaFuzz, ensure you have:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Burp Suite Pro" icon="/logo/burpsuite.svg">
    Version 2025.3 or later with Montoya API support
  </Card>
  <Card title="Java 21+" icon="java">
    Required for Burp Suite and Jython runtime
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
MutaFuzz requires **Burp Suite Professional**. The Community Edition lacks Montoya API support and cannot run this extension.
</Warning>

## Download Extension

### Option 1: GitHub Releases (Recommended)

1. Visit the [MutaFuzz Releases](https://github.com/theblackturtle/mutafuzz/releases) page
2. Download the latest `mutafuzz-vX.Y.Z.jar` file
3. Save to a memorable location (e.g., `~/burp-extensions/`)

### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/theblackturtle/mutafuzz.git
cd mutafuzz

# Build with Gradle
./gradlew build

# JAR will be in build/libs/
ls build/libs/mutafuzz-*.jar
```

<Note>
Building from source requires Java 21+ and Gradle. The built JAR includes all dependencies.
</Note>

## Install in Burp Suite

### Step 1: Open Extensions Panel

1. Launch Burp Suite Professional
2. Navigate to **Extensions** tab (top menu)
3. Click **Installed** sub-tab


### Step 2: Add Extension

1. Click **Add** button (bottom of panel)
2. In the "Extension Details" dialog:
   - **Extension type**: Select "Java"
   - **Extension file**: Click "Select file..." and choose `mutafuzz-vX.Y.Z.jar`
3. Click **Next**


### Step 3: Verify Installation

Watch the **Output** and **Errors** tabs at the bottom:

**Success Output:**
```text

```

<img src="/images/verify-extension.png" alt="Extension verification" />

**Common Errors:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ClassNotFoundException or NoClassDefFoundError">
    Your JAR may be corrupted or incomplete. Re-download from GitHub releases.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="UnsupportedClassVersionError">
    Your Java version is too old. Upgrade to Java 21 or later.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Montoya API not found">
    Update Burp Suite to version 2025.3 or later, which includes Montoya API.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 4: Access MutaFuzz Tab

Once installed, a new **MutaFuzz** tab appears in Burp's main menu:

1. Click **MutaFuzz** tab (next to Extensions, Target, etc.)
2. You should see the Dashboard with an empty fuzzer instances table

<img src="/images/mutafuzz-dashboard-empty.png" alt="MutaFuzz Dashboard on first launch" />

<Tip>
The dashboard is where you'll manage all your fuzzing sessions. Pin it as a favorite tab for quick access.
</Tip>

## Configuration

### Script Directory

By default, MutaFuzz includes built-in scripts. To use custom scripts:

1. Create a directory for your scripts (e.g., `~/mutafuzz-scripts/`)
2. In MutaFuzz dashboard, click **Settings**
3. Set "Script Directory" to your custom path
4. Scripts in this directory will appear in the script dropdown

<Tip>
Custom scripts override built-in scripts with the same name. Prefix with numbers (e.g., `010_my_script.py`) to control sort order.
</Tip>

## Update Extension

To update to a new version:

1. Download the latest JAR from GitHub releases
2. In Burp, go to **Extensions > Installed**
3. Select "MutaFuzz" and reload

<Note>
Active fuzzing sessions will be terminated when removing the extension. Save any important results first.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Won't Load

**Check Burp Version:**
1. Help > About Burp Suite
2. Verify version is 2025.3 or later
3. Check "Montoya API" is listed in features

### Extension Loads but Crashes

**Check Logs:**
1. Extensions > MutaFuzz > Errors tab
2. Look for stack traces
3. Report issues to GitHub with full error output

**Common Fixes:**
- Increase JVM heap size: `java -Xmx4g -jar burpsuite_pro.jar`
- Disable other extensions that might conflict

### Context Menu Missing

1. Verify extension shows as "Loaded" in Extensions panel
2. Check no errors in Errors tab
3. Try unloading and reloading the extension
4. Restart Burp Suite
